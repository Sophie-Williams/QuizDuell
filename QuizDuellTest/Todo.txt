Write some tests for the api.
Examples:
- Test the login method to make sure the md5 salt is still acurate.
- Test the EncodeHMAC method to make sure the HMAC key is still accurate.
- Test for encoding problems.
- Test the RestClient for edge cases.
- Test all the api calls to make sure their output is still the expected output.
